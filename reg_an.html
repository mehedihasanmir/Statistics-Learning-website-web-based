        <h2>What is Regression Analysis</h2>
        <section>
            Regression analysis is a set of statistical methods used for the estimation of relationships between a
            dependent variable and one or more independent variables. It can be utilized to assess the strength of the
            relationship between variables and for modeling the future relationship between them.

        <section>
            Regression analysis includes several variations, such as linear, multiple linear, and nonlinear. The most
            common models are simple linear and multiple linear. Nonlinear regression analysis is commonly used for more
            complicated data sets in which the dependent and independent variables show a nonlinear relationship.

                <h2>Linear Model Assumptions</h2>
                <p>Linear regression analysis is based on six fundamental assumptions:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>The dependent and independent variables show a linear relationship between the slope and the
                        intercept.</li>
                    <li>The independent variable is not random.</li>
                    <li>The value of the residual (error) is zero.</li>
                    <li>The value of the residual (error) is constant across all observations.</li>
                    <li>The value of the residual (error) is not correlated across all observations.</li>
                    <li>The residual (error) values follow the normal distribution.</li>
            </section>
            <section>
                <p>Simple linear regression is a model that assesses the relationship between a dependent variable and
                    an independent variable. The simple linear model is expressed using the following equation:</p>
            </section>
            <section>
                <b><p class="center">Y = a + bX + ϵ</p></b>
                <p>Where,</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Y – Dependent variable</li>
                    <li>X – Independent (explanatory) variable</li>
                    <li>a – Intercept</li>
                    <li>b – Slope</li>
                    <li>ϵ – Residual (error)</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

                <h2> Multiple Linear Regression</h2>
                <p>Multiple linear regression analysis is essentially similar to the simple linear model, with the
                    exception that multiple independent variables are used in the model. The mathematical representation
                    of multiple linear regression is: <br>
                </p>
                <b><p class="center">Y = a + bX1 + cX2 + dX3 + ϵ</p></b>
                <p>Where:</p>
                <div>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Y – Dependent variable</li>
                        <li>X1, X2, X3 – Independent (explanatory) variables</li>
                        <li>a – Intercept</li>
                        <li>b, c, d – Slopes</li>
                        <li>ϵ – Residual (error)</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Multiple linear regression follows the same conditions as the simple linear model. However, since
                        there are several independent variables in multiple linear analysis, there is another mandatory
                        condition for the model:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><i>
                                Non-collinearity: Independent variables should show a minimum correlation with each
                                other. If the independent variables are highly correlated with each other, it will be
                                difficult to assess the true relationships between the dependent and independent
                                variables.
                            </i>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
