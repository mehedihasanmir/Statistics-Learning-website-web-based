        <h3>Basic Question</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>What is statistics?</li>
            <li>What should i learn statistics as a computer science?</li>
            <li>What do you mean by population and sample?</li>
            <li>Difference between discrete and continuous?</li>
            <li>What do you mean by big Data?</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h3>Descriptive Statistics</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>For the dataset [8, 12, 15, 20, 25], calculate the mean and median.</li>
            <li>Calculate the range for the dataset: [32, 45, 28, 50, 35]</li>
            <li>If the standard deviation of a dataset is 10, what does this tell you about the spread of the data?
            </li>
            <li>If a student scores in the 75th percentile on a standardized test, what does that mean in terms of their
                performance compared to others?</li>
            <li>Define skewness and explain how positive and negative skewness differ.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h3>Inferential Statistics</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Explain the difference between random sampling and stratified sampling. Provide an example scenario
                where each would be appropriate.</li>
            <li>A researcher calculates a 95% confidence interval for the average height of a population to be between
                65 inches and 70 inches. Interpret this interval.</li>
            <li>If the correlation coefficient between two variables is 0.75, what does this indicate about the
                relationship between the variables? How would you interpret the slope in a simple linear regression
                equation?</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h3>Regression Analysis</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Define simple linear regression and provide an example of a scenario where it would be appropriate to
                use it.</li>
            <li>In a simple linear regression model
                �
                =
                5
                �
                +
                10
                Y=5X+10, interpret the coefficient 5 in terms of the relationship between the dependent variable (Y) and
                the independent variable (X).
            </li>
            <li>Explain what residuals are in the context of regression analysis. Why is it important to examine
                residual plots?</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h3>Probability Theory</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Define probability and provide an example of an event with a probability of 0, 1/2, and 1.</li>
            <li>Explain what conditional probability is and provide a formula for calculating it. Offer an example
                scenario to illustrate conditional probability.</li>
            <li>State the addition rule for probability and provide an example where it can be applied. How does this
                rule change for mutually exclusive events?</li>
            <li>Differentiate between combinations and permutations. Provide a real-world example where each concept
                would be applicable</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h3>Hypothesis Testing</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Define the null hypothesis and the alternative hypothesis. Provide an example of a research question
                along with corresponding null and alternative hypotheses.
            </li>
            <li>
                If the p-value for a hypothesis test is 0.03, what does this value indicate about the results? How does
                it influence the decision to reject or fail to reject the null hypothesis?
            </li>
            <li>Explain the concept of the significance level (alpha) in hypothesis testing. What is a common choice for
                alpha, and why?</li>
            <li>
                Compare and contrast z-tests and t-tests. In what situations would you use a z-test, and when would a
                t-test be more appropriate?
            </li>
        </ul>
