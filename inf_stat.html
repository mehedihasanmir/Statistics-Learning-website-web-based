        <h2>What is Inferential Statistics</h2>
        <div>Inferential statistics is a branch of statistics that makes the use of various analytical tools to draw
            inferences about the population data from sample data. Apart from inferential statistics, descriptive
            statistics forms another branch of statistics. Inferential statistics help to draw conclusions about the
            population while descriptive statistics summarizes the features of the data set.
