        <h2>what is Hypothesis Testing?</h2>
        <p>
            <b>Hypothesis Testing</b> is a formal procedure for investigating our ideas about the world using
            statistics. It is most often used by scientists to test specific predictions, called hypotheses, that arise
            from theories.
        </p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <u>There are 5 main steps in hypothesis testing:</u>
        <ol>
            <li>State your research hypothesis as a null hypothesis and alternate hypothesis (Ho) and (Ha or H1).</li>
            <li>Collect data in a way designed to test the hypothesis.</li>
            <li>Perform an appropriate statistical test.</li>
            <li>Decide whether to reject or fail to reject your null hypothesis.</li>
            <li>Present the findings in your results and discussion section.</li>
        </ol>
    </section>
    <section>
        <section>
            <h4>Step 1: State your null and alternate hypothesis</h4>
            <p>After developing your initial research hypothesis (the prediction that you want to investigate), it is
                important to restate it as a null (Ho) and alternate (Ha) hypothesis so that you can test it
                mathematically. <br>
            </p>
            <p>
                The alternate hypothesis is usually your initial hypothesis that predicts a relationship between
                variables. The null hypothesis is a prediction of no relationship between the variables you are
                interested in.
            </p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h5><u>Hypothesis testing example</u></h5>
            <p>
                You want to test whether there is a relationship between gender and height. Based on your knowledge of
                human physiology, you formulate a hypothesis that men are, on average, taller than women. To test this
                hypothesis, you restate it as:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>H0: Men are, on average, not taller than women.
                    Ha: Men are, on average, taller than women.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Step 2: Collect data</h3>
            <p>
                For a statistical test to be valid, it is important to perform sampling and collect data in a way that
                is designed to test your hypothesis. If your data are not representative, then you cannot make
                statistical inferences about the population you are interested in.
            </p>
            <h5><u>Example</u></h5>
            <section>
                To test differences in average height between men and women, your sample should have an equal proportion
                of men and women, and cover a variety of socio-economic classes and any other control variables that
                might influence average height.
            </section>
            <section>
                You should also consider your scope (Worldwide? For one country?) A potential data source in this case
                might be census data, since it includes data from a variety of regions and social classes and is
                available for many countries around the world.
            </section>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Step 3: Perform a statistical test</h3>
            <p>
            <div>There are a variety of statistical tests available, but they are all based on the comparison of
                within-group variance (how spread out the data is within a category) versus between-group variance (how
                different the categories are from one another).
            </div>
            <div>
                If the between-group variance is large enough that there is little or no overlap between groups, then
                your statistical test will reflect that by showing a low p-value. This means it is unlikely that the
                differences between these groups came about by chance.
            </div>
            <div>
                Alternatively, if there is high within-group variance and low between-group variance, then your
                statistical test will reflect that with a high p-value. This means it is likely that any difference you
                measure between groups is due to chance.
            </div>
            <div>
                Your choice of statistical test will be based on the type of variables and the level of measurement of
                your collected data.
            </div>
            </p>
            <section>
                <h5><u>Example</u></h5>
                <p>Based on the type of data you collected, you perform a one-tailed t-test to test whether men are in
                    fact taller than women. This test gives you:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>an estimate of the difference in average height between the two groups.</li>
                    <li>a p-value showing how likely you are to see this difference if the null hypothesis of no
                        difference is true.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Your t-test shows an average height of 175.4 cm for men and an average height of 161.7 cm for women,
                    with an estimate of the true difference ranging from 10.2 cm to infinity. The p-value is 0.002.
                </p>
            </section>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Step 4: Decide whether to reject or fail to reject your null hypothesis</h3>
            <div>
                Based on the outcome of your statistical test, you will have to decide whether to reject or fail to
                reject your null hypothesis.
            </div>
            <div>
                In most cases you will use the p-value generated by your statistical test to guide your decision. And in
                most cases, your predetermined level of significance for rejecting the null hypothesis will be 0.05 –
                that is, when there is a less than 5% chance that you would see these results if the null hypothesis
                were true.
            </div>
            <div>
                In some cases, researchers choose a more conservative level of significance, such as 0.01 (1%). This
                minimizes the risk of incorrectly rejecting the null hypothesis (Type I error).
            </div>
            <div>
                <h5><u>Example</u></h5>
                <p>
                    In your analysis of the difference in average height between men and women, you find that the
                    p-value of 0.002 is below your cutoff of 0.05, so you decide to reject your null hypothesis of no
                    difference.
                </p>
            </div>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Step 5: Present your findings</h3>
            <div>
                The results of hypothesis testing will be presented in the results and discussion sections of your
                research paper, dissertation or thesis.
            </div>
            <div>
                In the results section you should give a brief summary of the data and a summary of the results of your
                statistical test (for example, the estimated difference between group means and associated p-value). In
                the discussion, you can discuss whether your initial hypothesis was supported by your results or not.
            </div>
            <div>
                In the formal language of hypothesis testing, we talk about rejecting or failing to reject the null
                hypothesis. You will probably be asked to do this in your statistics assignments.
            </div>
            <div>
                <h5><u>Stating results in a statistics assignment</u></h5>
                <p>
                    In our comparison of mean height between men and women we found an average difference of 13.7 cm and
                    a p-value of 0.002; therefore, we can reject the null hypothesis that men are not taller than women
                    and conclude that there is likely a difference in height between men and women.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div>
                However, when presenting research results in academic papers we rarely talk this way. Instead, we go
                back to our alternate hypothesis (in this case, the hypothesis that men are on average taller than
                women) and state whether the result of our test did or did not support the alternate hypothesis.
            </div>
            <div>
                If your null hypothesis was rejected, this result is interpreted as “supported the alternate
                hypothesis.”
            </div>
            <div>
                <h5><u>Stating results in a research paper</u></h5>
                <p>
                    We found a difference in average height between men and women of 14.3cm, with a p-value of 0.002,
                    consistent with our hypothesis that there is a difference in height between men and women.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div>These are superficial differences; you can see that they mean the same thing.</div>
            <div>
                You might notice that we don’t say that we reject or fail to reject the alternate hypothesis. This is
                because hypothesis testing is not designed to prove or disprove anything. It is only designed to test
                whether a pattern we measure could have arisen spuriously, or by chance.
            </div>
            <div>
                If we reject the null hypothesis based on our research (i.e., we find that it is unlikely that the
                pattern arose by chance), then we can say our test lends support to our hypothesis. But if the pattern
                does not pass our decision rule, meaning that it could have arisen by chance, then we say the test is
                inconsistent with our hypothesis.
