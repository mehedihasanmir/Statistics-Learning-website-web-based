        <h2>What is Descriptive statistics? </h2>
        <p>
            Descriptive statistics is a branch of statistics that deals with the collection, analysis, interpretation,
            presentation, and organization of data. Its primary goal is to summarize and describe the main features of a
            dataset. Descriptive statistics help in simplifying and presenting large amounts of data in a meaningful and
            comprehensible way.

            <h2>Types of descriptive statistics</h2>
            <p>
                There are 3 main types of descriptive statistics:
            <ol>
                <li>The distribution concerns the frequency of each value.</li>
                <li>The central tendency concerns the averages of the values.</li>
                <li>The variability or dispersion concerns how spread out the values are.</li>
            </ol>
            </p>

            <h2>Mean</h2>
            <p>The sum of all values divided by the number of observations <br> <br>
                Mean = sum of all value / N
            </p>

                <h2>Median</h2>
                <p>
                    The middle value when data is sorted; it separates the higher half from the lower half. <br>
                    Median = Sum of two middle index number /2 for even number
                    Median = Middle number for odd number

                <p>The square root of the variance; it indicates the average deviation from the mean.</p>

                <p>The range between the first quartile (Q1) and the third quartile (Q3), representing the middle 50% of
                    the data. <br>

            <h2>DISTRIBUTION</h2>
            <section>The term "distribution" in statistics refers to the pattern or shape that a set of data follows. It
                describes how the values are spread out or distributed across different levels. There are several types
                of statistical distributions, each with its own characteristics. Here are some commonly encountered
                distributions in statistics:

                <h3>Normal Distribution</h3>
                <p>In a normal distribution, data is symmetrically distributed with no skew. When plotted on a
                    graph, the data follows a bell shape, with most values clustering around a central region and
                    tapering off as they go further away from the center.</p>

                <h3>Binomial Distribution</h3>
                <section>In probability theory and statistics, the binomial distribution is the discrete probability
                    distribution that gives only two possible results in an experiment, either Success or Failure.
                    For example, if we toss a coin, there could be only two possible outcomes: heads or tails, and
                    if any test is taken, then there could be only two results: pass or fail. This distribution is
                    also called a binomial probability distribution.

                <section>
                    There are two parameters n and p used here in a binomial distribution. The variable ‘n’ states the
                    number of times the experiment runs and the variable ‘p’ tells the probability of any one outcome.
                    Suppose a die is thrown randomly 10 times, then the probability of getting 2 for anyone throw is ⅙.
                    When you throw the dice 10 times, you have a binomial distribution of n = 10 and p = ⅙. Learn the
                    formula to calculate the two outcome distribution among multiple experiments along with solved
                    examples here in this article.
