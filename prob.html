        <h2>What is Probability Theory?</h2>
        <p>
            Probability theory is a field of mathematics and statistics that is concerned with finding the probabilities
            associated with random events. There are two main approaches available to study probability theory. These
            are theoretical probability and experimental probability. Theoretical probability is determined on the basis
            of logical reasoning without conducting experiments. In contrast, experimental probability is determined on
            the basis of historic data by performing repeated experiments.

        <h2>Example of Probability Theory</h2>
        <p>
            Suppose the probability of obtaining a number 4 on rolling a fair dice needs to be established. The number
            of favorable outcomes is 1. The possible outcomes of the dice are {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}. This implies that
            there are a total of 6 outcomes. Thus, the probability of obtaining 4 on a dice roll, using probability
            theory, can be computed as 1 / 6 = 0.167.

        <h2>Some basic topic of probability theory</h2>
        <p>
            There are some basic terminologies associated with probability theory that aid in the understanding of this
            field of mathematics.

            <h3>Random Experiment</h3>
            <p>A random experiment, in probability theory, can be defined as a trial that is repeated multiple times in
                order to get a well-defined set of possible outcomes. Tossing a coin is an example of a random
                experiment.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Sample Space</h3>
            <p>Sample space can be defined as the set of all possible outcomes that result from conducting a random
                experiment. For example, the sample space of tossing a fair coin is {heads, tails}.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Event</h3>
            <p>Probability theory defines an event as a set of outcomes of an experiment that forms a subset of the
                sample space. The types of events are given as follows:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Independent events: Events that are not affected by other events are independent events.</li>
                <li>Dependent events: Events that are affected by other events are known as dependent events.</li>
                <li>Mutually exclusive events: Events that cannot take place at the same time are mutually exclusive
                    events.</li>
                <li>Equally likely events: Two or more events that have the same chance of occurring are known as
                    equally likely events.</li>
                <li>Exhaustive events: An exhaustive event is one that is equal to the sample space of an experiment.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Random Variable</h3>
            <p>In probability theory, a random variable can be defined as a variable that assumes the value of all
                possible outcomes of an experiment. There are two types of random variables as given below.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Discrete Random Variable: Discrete random variables can take an exact countable value such as 0, 1,
                    2... It can be described by the cumulative distribution function and the probability mass function.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Continuous Random Variable: A variable that can take on an infinite number of values is known as a
                    continuous random variable. The cumulative distribution function and probability density function
                    are used to define the characteristics of this variable.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Probability</h3>
            <p>Probability, in probability theory, can be defined as the numerical likelihood of occurrence of an event.
                The probability of an event taking place will always lie between 0 and 1. This is because the number of
                desired outcomes can never exceed the total number of outcomes of an event. Theoretical probability and
                empirical probability are used in probability theory to measure the chance of an event taking place.

            <h3>Conditional Probability</h3>
            <p>
                When the likelihood of occurrence of an event needs to be determined given that another event has
                already taken place, it is known as conditional probability. It is denoted as P(A | B). This represents
                the conditional probability of event A given that event B has already occurred.
            </p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Expectation</h3>
            <p>
                The expectation of a random variable, X, can be defined as the average value of the outcomes of an
                experiment when it is conducted multiple times. It is denoted as E[X]. It is also known as the mean of
                the random variable.

        <h2>Probability Theory Formulas</h2>
        <p>There are many formulas in probability theory that help in calculating the various probabilities associated
            with events. The most important probability theory formulas are listed below.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Theoretical probability: Number of favorable outcomes / Number of possible outcomes.</li>
